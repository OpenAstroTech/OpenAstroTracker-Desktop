	* Uncomment #define SUPPORT_SERIAL_CONTROL in Globals.h
	* Leave #define DEBUG_MODE in Globals.h commented.
	
* Supported ASCOM Properties and Methods
	* Documented in included spreadsheet
	* Note : Implementation of a property does not mean it "does stuff", merely that it will return a value instead of an exception.  The value may never change.

* Last Conformance Test - 2020-04-13

* Cautions and warnings
	* CAUTION : Neither the mount nor the driver currently support setting any slew limits.  Thus it is quite possible the mount may be told to slew to a position that causes a crash
				with some gadget you've printed and added, or results in an untennable position for your camera, or any number of other "Bad Things (tm)".  So...keep track of your own towel.

* Known Issues
	* All known current issues are probably documented at https://github.com/ClutchplateDude/OpenAstroTracker/issues 
	
* Work in Progress / Coming soon
	* A simple PC Control application is being developed.
		* You are welcome to play with the PC Control code included in "OAT PC Control" in this branch, but be aware it's not ready for prime time yet.
	* Implementation of AltAz methods and properties
	* Ability to set home position of mount via ASCOM
